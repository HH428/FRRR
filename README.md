The penetration of wind and solar keeps increasing, meanwhile conventional generators have been retiring.  Due to the lack of flexibility from the energy supply side, modern energy systems may have issues balancing the supply and demand in real-time.

Based on the real data of in partial CA region, this work aims to estimate the flexibility required for demand-side resources under different penetration level of wind and solar.
